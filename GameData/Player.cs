     * A common approach is to use an exponential or polynomial curve.
     * For example, we could use:
     * ExperienceNeeded = BaseExperience * (Level ^ Exponent)

     * We need to consider how the game will notify the player when they reach a new level.
     * This should be an EVENT that other parts of the game can listen to.
     * For example, we could implement an event system where the PlayerLevel class
     * raises a LevelUp event whenever the experience crosses the threshold for the next level.
